Reset The Net - Privacy Pack
============================

The Reset the Net privacy pack will be a selection of software and tips tailored to common computers, phones, and tablets that literally anyone can use.

Our goal is to accommodate literally everyone, and offer bonus tools and instructions for more technical users. Since the tools will be pretty much universal, it should be easy for people to share the privacy packs with friends.

It'll provide tools and tips for iPhone, Android, Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux, and everything will be free software.
